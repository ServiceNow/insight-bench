      "reasoning": "In many real-world scenarios, certain times of the year see increased incident reports due to specific events or seasonal spikes (e.g., end of the year system overloads, holiday-related system issues). By simulating such spikes, we can test the model's ability to discern topics that are more prevalent in certain seasons, thus enhancing its temporal awareness and improving the granularity of topic modeling.",
      "relevance_to_kpi": "Affects 'Diverse Topic Representations' by introducing new seasonal topics, and enhances 'Timeliness of Resolution' due to potentially increased urgency during spikes.",

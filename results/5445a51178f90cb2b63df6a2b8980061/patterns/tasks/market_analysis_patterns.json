      "reasoning": "Quarterly spikes in network-related incidents can be realistic due to increased network usage as companies close financial quarters, leading to potential systems overload. This pattern helps observe how models cope with temporal spikes in incident volume.",

      "reasoning": "Following public holidays, many companies experience a backlog of user requests, increasing the urgency as tasks accumulate. This pattern tests the model's ability to handle priority surges.",
      "relevance_to_kpi": "Impacts the 'SLA Achievement' and 'Incident Resolution Time' KPIs by testing the ability to manage incidents under increased urgency conditions.",
      "benchmark_value": "Evaluates how well models respond to changes in incident urgency and handle predictions in post-holiday periods."

      "benchmark_value": "Challenges models to recognize the impact of external events (software releases) on incident resolution efficiency, a key aspect of real-world market analysis."

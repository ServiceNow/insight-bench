      "relevance_to_kpi": "This pattern impacts the 'Incidents resolved within SLA' and 'Average resolution time' as high-priority incidents might require faster resolution and more resources, thus affecting resolution times and adherence to SLAs.",

      "reasoning": "Simulate a trend where certain assignment groups consistently take longer to resolve incidents than others. This may be due to expertise levels, resource allocations, or process inefficiencies.",
      "relevance_to_kpi": "Affects 'Average resolution time' and 'Incident churn rate' by potentially increasing resolution times and decreasing efficiency, leading to higher churn if incidents are not resolved promptly.",

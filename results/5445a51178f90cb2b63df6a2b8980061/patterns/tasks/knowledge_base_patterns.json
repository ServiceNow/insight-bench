      "pattern": "Introduce random spikes in 'Business duration', 'Duration', and 'Resolve time' for tickets classified as '1 - Critical' and 'priority 1'. This should mimic urgent issues that take unexpectedly long to resolve.",

      "reasoning": "In real-world scenarios, critical incidents often have spikes in resolution time due to complexity or resource availability. Mimicking this behavior can test a model's ability to adapt to outliers and recognize patterns that lead to extended resolutions.",
      "relevance_to_kpi": "Incident Resolution Time will increase for critical incidents, affecting understanding of time management and resource allocation benchmarks.",
      "benchmark_value": "This pattern challenges analytical models to distinguish between typical incidents and outliers, testing robustness in anomaly detection."
    },
    {
      "pattern": "Create a temporal shift where incidents opened in specific time frames (e.g., weekends) show a delay in 'Resolved' and 'Closed' times. This depicts lower staff availability or prioritization issues during off-hours.",

      "reasoning": "Operational bottlenecks during off-hours are common in support centers, affecting incident resolution rates. This pattern tests a model's capability to account for temporal variability in data analysis.",
      "relevance_to_kpi": "SLA Compliance Rate and Incident Resolution Time will be impacted, as off-hours resolution rates tend to be slower.",
      "benchmark_value": "Such patterns evaluate a model's ability to incorporate temporal dynamics into predictions and improve scheduling and staffing strategies."

      "relevance_to_kpi": "Active Incident Rate and Reassignment Count should reflect an observable decrease in the latter period, indicating improvements in incident handling.",
      "benchmark_value": "This pattern tests a model's ability to detect regime shifts and accurately attribute performance changes to strategic interventions."

      "reasoning": "This pattern mimics the real-world scenario where service departments might have different workload and efficiency profiles during weekdays versus weekends. It can simulate processing bottlenecks that are common in IT services during workdays.",
      "relevance_to_kpi": "This pattern directly impacts Incident Resolution Time, potentially causing delays in weekday incidents compared to weekend ones, and impacts service quality analyses.",
      "benchmark_value": "It tests the model's ability to capture temporal workload effects, allowing assessment of algorithms that optimize incident resolutions differently by day."

      "reasoning": "Such regime shifts are realistic as businesses sometimes face sudden changes in policy or environment, requiring immediate attention to high-priority incidents.",
      "relevance_to_kpi": "It affects Priority-based Incident Handling KPI by increasing the pressure on high-priority incidents, impacting metrics like resolution time and state transitions.",
      "benchmark_value": "This pattern evaluates the model's capacity to adjust for rapid changes in priority dynamics and ensures it can prioritize effectively under stress."

      "reasoning": "This anomaly reflects a common issue in incident management systems where misrouting or mislabeling can occur, impacting operational efficiency.",
      "relevance_to_kpi": "It impacts both Incident Resolution Time and SLA compliance due to increased time needed for corrections and reprocessing.",
      "benchmark_value": "This pattern challenges models to handle routing anomalies and incorporate historical corrective action into model learning and decision-making processes."

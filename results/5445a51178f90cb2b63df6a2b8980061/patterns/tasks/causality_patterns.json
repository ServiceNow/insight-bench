      "reasoning": "In many organizations, certain periods, such as end of fiscal quarters, see a spike in incident reporting due to increased workloads and system use. By introducing a seasonal spike in incident creation during a particular time range, the model's ability to recognize temporal patterns and potential causative triggers like work stress or increased demand on systems can be evaluated.",

      "reasoning": "Introduce periods where certain assignment groups have a shortage of staff, resulting in delayed incident resolution and higher reassignment counts. This reflects real-world scenarios where unexpected events such as sick leaves or staffing transitions affect service delivery.",
      "relevance_to_kpi": "This affects the Priority Incidents Resolution and Escalation Rate KPIs, as critical incidents might take longer to resolve, leading to escalations.",
      "benchmark_value": "Challenges models to identify staffing-related bottlenecks in resolution processes and assess their impact on incident handling efficiency."

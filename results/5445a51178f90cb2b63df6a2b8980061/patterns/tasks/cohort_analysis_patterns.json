      "reasoning": "In real-world settings, planned upgrades or deployments often result in temporary spikes in incidents due to system instability or configuration issues. This pattern reflects an occurrence that system administrators and support teams frequently encounter.",
      "relevance_to_kpi": "This pattern affects 'Incident Volume Over Time' and can lead to increased 'Incident Resolution Time' due to the surge in volume. Such spikes challenge models to accurately assess workload and resource allocation efficiency during periods of high demand.",
      "benchmark_value": "Tests the model's ability to identify and adapt to time-bound anomalies and highlights the importance of understanding temporal workload patterns for resource planning."

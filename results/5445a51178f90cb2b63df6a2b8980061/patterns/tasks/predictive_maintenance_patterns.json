This mimics a real-world scenario where service demands peak, and could lead to delays in resolution times due to increased volume.",

      "reasoning": "Implement a conditional pattern where incidents with '1 - Critical' priority that remain unresolved for more than a certain duration automatically escalate from 'Normal' to 'High'. This models real-world escalation policies in place to prevent critical issues from being overlooked.",
      "relevance_to_kpi": "Directly affects the SLA Adherence Rate and Time to Resolution by forcing quicker resolutions when escalations occur. Incidents should resolve faster once escalated.",

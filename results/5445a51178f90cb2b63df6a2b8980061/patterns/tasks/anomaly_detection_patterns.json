      "relevance_to_kpi": "This pattern impacts 'High Priority Incident Count' by creating temporary surges in incidents, testing the model's ability to detect them.",

      "relevance_to_kpi": "Directly affects the 'Average Resolution Time' and 'SLA Compliance Rate' by introducing significant delays, impacting SLA adherence and resolution efficiency.",

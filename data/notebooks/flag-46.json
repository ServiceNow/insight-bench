This suggests that there may be common issues or misunderstandings about allowable expenses in this category, which need to be addressed.\n\n3. **Enhancing Policy Adherence:** By understanding the patterns of duplicate claims and rejections, the dataset provides a foundation for revising guidelines, improving training, and enhancing overall compliance with financial policies, thereby reducing the risk of financial wastage and unauthorized expense claims."

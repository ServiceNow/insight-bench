This indicates that delays or efficiencies are predominantly associated with the expense amount rather than specific departmental or individual practices.\n\n3. **Operational Insights:** The analysis provides valuable insights into the processing dynamics of expense claims, highlighting potential areas for operational improvement. By examining the relationship between expense amount and processing time, organizations can optimize their financial workflows to enhance efficiency and equity in expense processing."

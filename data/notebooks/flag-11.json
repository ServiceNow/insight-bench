This trend suggests challenges in resolving these incidents efficiently.\n2. **Cause of Increased TTR**: The linear increase in TTR coincides with an increase in the volume of hardware incidents. where there is spike number of hardware incidents between July and August months in 2023. This surge may be attributed to factors such as new hardware deployments, software updates, or external influences like peak usage times and increased demand.\n3. **Location of the spikes**: Hardware incidents predominantly occur in Australia during spikes from 2023-06 to 2023-08.\n4. **Reason and Impact Assessment**: The growing frequency and prolonged resolution times of hardware incidents is mostly due to email server outage issue and could strain resources and affect overall service delivery, highlighting the need for adjustment and repairs."

This is contrary to the typical expectation where higher priority goals are more successful.\n\n2. **Impact of Cross-Departmental Collaboration**: The analysis highlights that tasks classified as cross-departmental consistently show higher completion percentages and target achievement compared to non-cross-departmental tasks. This suggests that collaborative efforts across departments enhance task performance and contribute to the observed success rates, particularly in goals like 'Cost Reduction.'\n\n3. **Broad Success across Categories**: Despite their lower priority status, 'Cost Reduction' goals not only outperform within their category but also show widespread higher success rates across various categories at similar priority levels. This is further amplified when these goals involve cross-departmental collaboration, indicating a strategic advantage in collaborative efforts."

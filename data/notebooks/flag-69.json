This suggests a need for process review within the Finance department to improve efficiency.\n\n2. **Expense Cost Bracket Impact on Processing**: Insights from Question 2 reveal that higher-cost expenses experience longer processing times, with the very high expense bracket (> $6000) averaging 27 days. This indicates a need for streamlining approval workflows for larger expenses to reduce delays.\n\n3. **Uniform Processing Times for High-Cost Expenses**: Question 3 highlights that processing times for expenses over $5000 are uniformly distributed across departments and users. This suggests that the high cost inherently requires a consistent processing approach, emphasizing the importance of efficient yet robust approval processes."

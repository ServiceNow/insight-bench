Employees based in high-retention cities like Tokyo and London tend to have longer tenures, suggesting that geographic location influences retention patterns and potentially affects managerial workload distribution.\n\n2. **Reportee Distribution**: The IT department remains markedly understaffed in terms of managerial positions, with an average of 50 reportees per manager. This issue is further exacerbated in high-retention locations where longer employee tenures may lead to increased workload and sustained pressure on managers over time.\n\n3. **Individual Manager Analysis**: A disparity is observed within the IT department, where a manager named Ed Gompf handles a disproportionately high number of reportees. This situation is particularly concerning in high-retention locations, where Ed Gompf\u2019s already heavy workload may be compounded by the longer tenures of his reportees, potentially leading to burnout and inefficiencies in management."

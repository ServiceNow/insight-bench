This suggests a focus on critical resources or strategic investments during this period, highlighting the need for budget scrutiny and potential resource alignment across departments.\n\n2. **Uniform Processing Times Across Categories**: Insights from Question 2 indicate that processing times are uniform across different expense categories within departments. This suggests that factors other than the nature of expenses, such as staffing or workflow systems, may influence processing efficiency, pointing to areas for operational improvement.\n\n3. **Expense Amount Brackets and Processing Efficiency**: Findings from Question 3 show that lower expense brackets, particularly those under $100, are processed more quickly in the Development department. This efficiency could be attributed to streamlined approval processes, offering a model for other departments to enhance processing times for smaller expenses."

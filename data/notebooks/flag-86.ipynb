    "### Dataset Overview\n",
    "This dataset comprises 500 simulated entries from the ServiceNow `fm_expense_line` table, which tracks various attributes of financial expenses. Key fields include 'number', 'opened_at', 'amount', 'state', 'short_description', 'ci', 'user', 'department', 'category', 'process_date', 'source_id', and 'type'. The table provides a comprehensive record of financial transactions, capturing the expense amount, departmental allocation, and the nature of each expense. It offers a detailed view of organizational expenditures across various categories, highlighting both the timing and the approval status of each financial entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Objective\n",
    "**Objective**: Examine how the cost of an expense impacts its processing time, with the goal of improving the efficiency and equity of expense report processing across all cost levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Role**: Financial Operations Analyst\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge Level**: 2 out of 5. This analysis requires a focused examination of processing times in relation to expense amounts, involving advanced data manipulation and analytical skills to develop effective operational strategies applicable across the board.\n",

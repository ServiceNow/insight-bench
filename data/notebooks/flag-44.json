Keywords such as 'Travel' and 'Other' are associated with higher amounts, whereas 'Service' is linked to lower amounts. This relationship underscores the importance of descriptive language in financial oversight and budgeting.\n\n3. **Recurring Expense Patterns**: The dataset includes recurring expenses, such as monthly software subscriptions and maintenance fees, that recur consistently each month. This insight into recurring payments can aid in better financial planning and predictability, allowing for more efficient resource allocation and budget management."

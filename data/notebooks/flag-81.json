    "summary": "\n\n1. **Comparison of Goal Durations in Finance vs. Other Departments**: The absence of the `end_date` column prevents the analysis of how the durations of 'Cost Reduction' goals in the Finance department compare to those in other departments, limiting insights into departmental efficiency.\n\n2. **Impact of Time of Year on Task Completion Rates**: Without the `start_date` column, it is impossible to analyze how the completion rates of tasks vary by quarter, preventing an understanding of any seasonal trends in task performance.\n\n3. **Distribution of Goal Types and Categories in Finance**: The lack of the `department` column restricts the ability to analyze the distribution of goal types and categories specifically within the Finance department, hindering targeted performance analysis.\n\n4. **Distribution of Goal Priorities in Finance**: The absence of the `department` column also limits the ability to assess the distribution of goal priorities in the Finance department, making it difficult to identify focus areas and potential improvement strategies."

This suggests a periodic peak in service-related activities, potentially linked to contract renewals or end-of-quarter financial reviews.\n\n2. **Cost Bracket Processing Dynamics**: Question 2 reveals an unexpected trend where lower-cost expenses (<$1000) experience significantly longer processing times compared to higher-cost ones. This counterintuitive finding suggests inefficiencies in handling smaller transactions, possibly due to more complex approval processes or less prioritization.\n\n3. **Uniform Processing Across Departments and Users**: As derived from Question 3, the processing times for lower-cost expenses are uniform across different departments and users. This indicates that the delays are more related to the expense amount rather than specific departmental or individual practices, suggesting a need for streamlined processes for low-cost expenses."

This indicates a balanced workload distribution among team members, which is essential for maintaining operational efficiency and performance.\n2. **Need for Intervention**: All agents face a high number of incidents (100) assigned to them. This suggests a potential overload situation that requires immediate attention to prevent burnout and ensure timely incident resolution."

This trend is a significant factor contributing to overtime and potential agent burnout, as agents are required to handle more incidents without a proportional increase in resources etc.\n3. **Agent Productivity and Burnout**: While agents remain productive, the elevated number of incidents over time has led to increased working hours potentially impacting their wellbeing."

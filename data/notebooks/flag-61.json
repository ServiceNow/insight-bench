The `incidents` table focuses on detailing various attributes such as category, state, open and close dates, involved personnel, and incident specifics like location, description, and priority. It effectively captures incident management activities with fields including 'opened_at', 'closed_at', 'assigned_to', 'short_description', and 'priority', reflecting the operational handling and urgency of issues across different locations and categories. The `sys_user` table, on the other hand, contains user-related information, focusing on the details of employees or system users. This includes fields such as 'user_id', 'name', 'role', 'email', 'schedule', and 'department', providing insights into the user profiles managed within the ServiceNow system. Together, these tables are instrumental in understanding the workflow, user involvement and detailed tracking of incident resolution processes within an organization.",

This suggests potential workflow bottlenecks that could be addressed to improve efficiency.\n\n2. **Expense Report Distribution**: Question 2 revealed that there is no direct correlation between the number of expense reports submitted and their rejection rates. Notably, the IT department, despite submitting fewer reports, has a higher rejection rate, indicating possible issues in their reporting process.\n\n3. **Expense Amount Variability**: According to Question 3, Customer Support and Sales departments have the highest total expenses, with Customer Support leading in both spending and the number of expense instances. This highlights the need for closer evaluation of operational spending to identify potential cost-saving opportunities."

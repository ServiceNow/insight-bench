In contrast, Customer Support and IT departments show significant cost variability with frequent outliers, suggesting mixed asset types or varying equipment quality levels.\n\n2. **Average Cost by Model Category** (Question 2): Servers and Web Servers are the most expensive asset categories on average, followed by computers. This highlights the need for careful budgeting and procurement strategies to manage these high-cost investments effectively.\n\n3. **Correlation Between Cost and Warranty Period** (Question 3): There is a strong correlation where more expensive computer assets tend to have shorter warranty periods. This suggests that organizations may need to negotiate extended warranty terms for high-value assets or prioritize lower-cost computers to benefit from longer warranty coverage."

    "summary": "\n\n1. **Missing Data on Goal Achievement**: The dataset indicates a lack of the `percent_complete` column, preventing any analysis on the distribution of success rates for goals met across departments. Consequently, insights into departmental performance cannot be generated.\n\n2. **Impact of Completion on Success Metrics**: There is no available data on the `target_percentage` column, which hinders the ability to analyze how achieving high completion in Cost Reduction tasks may impact the success metrics of related Revenue Growth tasks.\n\n3. **Departmental Prioritization Analysis**: The absence of a `department` column restricts analysis on the proportion of goals classified as High or Critical priority in the IT department compared to other departments. This limits understanding of how prioritization may differ across departments."

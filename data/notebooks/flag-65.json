This insight highlights the need for strategic budget allocation to align with departmental priorities and asset-intensive operations.\n\n2. **Predictability of Warranty Periods**: Question 2 revealed a linear trend between asset purchase dates and warranty periods, suggesting that newer assets tend to have longer warranties. This predictability can guide procurement strategies to secure favorable warranty terms, optimizing asset lifecycle management.\n\n3. **Asset Costs Nearing Warranty Expiration**: As per Question 3, Product Management and Sales departments have the highest average costs for assets nearing warranty expiration. This indicates a potential need for budget prioritization in these departments to manage upcoming asset replacements effectively."

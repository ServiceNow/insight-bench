This suggests it is taking longer to resolve incidents.\n   \n2. **Plausible Reason:** The analysis showed there is a correlation between the volume of incidents and the ttr. The positive correlation between the volume of incidents and the TTR suggests that as the volume of incidents increases, the TTR also tends to increase. This could be due to resource constraints or inefficiencies in handling a larger volume of incidents. Other potential reasons could include complexity of incidents, or resource constraints.\n   \n3. **Other Factors:** Another aspect to consider is whether agents possess the required skills and capacity to handle these incidents effectively, indicating potential areas for capacity development or process enhancement."

    "### Dataset Overview\n",
    "This dataset contains 500 simulated entries from the ServiceNow `fm_expense_line` table, which captures various details of financial expenses. Key attributes include 'number', 'opened_at', 'amount', 'state', 'short_description', 'ci', 'user', 'department', 'category', 'process_date', 'source_id', and 'type'. The table provides a comprehensive record of financial transactions, detailing the amount, departmental allocation, and nature of each expense. It offers a clear view of organizational expenditures across different categories, highlighting the timing and approval status of each financial entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Objective\n",
    "**Objective**: Investigate the factors leading to quicker expense processing times within a specific department and assess whether these practices can be implemented to enhance efficiency across all departments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Role**: Operational Efficiency Analyst\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge Level**: 3 out of 5. This analysis requires strong data manipulation and interpretation skills to derive actionable insights from financial expense data.\n",

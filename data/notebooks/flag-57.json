This suggests it is taking shorter to resolve incidents.\n   \n2. **Plausible Reason:** The correlation between the volume of incidents and TTR is negative, indicating that as the volume of incidents increases, the TTR decreases. This suggests that the team is becoming more efficient in resolving incidents as the volume increases.\n   \n3. **Other Factors:** The increase in TTR is not uniform across all categories. Some categories show a more pronounced increase in TTR compared to others. This could be due to the complexity or nature of incidents in those categories."

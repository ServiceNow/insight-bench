The categories 'Software', 'Hardware', and 'Network' have the highest number of incidents, while 'Database' and 'Security' have relatively fewer incidents. This indicates a balanced distribution of incidents across different categories.\n \n2. **Plausible Explanation:** The distribution of incidents across categories is likely influenced by the nature of the services provided, the complexity of the systems, and the frequency of issues encountered in each category. The higher number of incidents in 'Software', 'Hardware', and 'Network' categories may be due to the common occurrence of software bugs, hardware failures, and network connectivity issues in IT environments."

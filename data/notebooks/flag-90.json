Key fields include 'number', 'opened_at', 'amount', 'state', 'short_description', 'ci', 'user', 'department', 'category', 'processed_date', 'source_id', and 'type'. This table documents the flow of financial transactions by detailing the amount, departmental allocation, and the nature of each expense. It provides a comprehensive view of organizational expenditures across different categories, highlighting both the timing and the approval state of each financial entry. Additionally, the dataset offers insights into the efficiency of expense processing based on different states, revealing potential areas for workflow optimization.",

Key fields include 'number', 'opened_at', 'amount', 'state', 'short_description', 'ci', 'user', 'department', 'category', 'processed_date', 'source_id', and 'type'. This table documents the flow of financial transactions by detailing the amount, departmental allocation, and the nature of each expense. It provides a comprehensive view of organizational expenditures across different categories, highlighting both the timing and the approval state of each financial entry. Additionally, the dataset offers insights into the efficiency of expense processing based on different states, revealing potential areas for workflow optimization.",

However, the dataset is missing key columns such as 'department', 'user', and 'processing_time_hours', which are essential for conducting the analysis.\n\n2. **Insight into User Behavior:** No analysis could be performed due to the missing 'user' column. This column is crucial for identifying repeated identical expense claims by individual users.\n\n3. **State-Based Processing Time Analysis:** The analysis could not be completed because the 'processing_time_hours' column is missing from the dataset. This column is necessary to compare processing times for expenses in various states such as Processed, Declined, Submitted, and Pending.\n\n4. **Expense Distribution by Department:** The analysis could not be completed because the 'department' column is missing from the dataset. This column is needed to plot the distribution of expenses across different departments."

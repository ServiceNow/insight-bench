However, the dataset is missing key columns such as 'department', 'user', and 'processing_time_hours', which are essential for conducting the analysis.\n\n2. **Insight into User Behavior:** No analysis could be performed due to the missing 'user' column. This column is crucial for identifying repeated identical expense claims by individual users.\n\n3. **State-Based Processing Time Analysis:** The analysis could not be completed because the 'processing_time_hours' column is missing from the dataset. This column is necessary to compare processing times for expenses in various states such as Processed, Declined, Submitted, and Pending.\n\n4. **Expense Distribution by Department:** The analysis could not be completed because the 'department' column is missing from the dataset. This column is needed to plot the distribution of expenses across different departments."

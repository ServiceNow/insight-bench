This suggests a significant event or project requiring increased scheduling, indicating a need for coordinated planning across departments.\n\n2. **Managerial Workload Disparity**: Question 2 highlights a disproportionate number of reportees per manager in the IT department, with an average of 50.5 reportees per manager. This is significantly higher compared to other departments, suggesting potential management inefficiencies and the need for staffing adjustments.\n\n3. **Individual Manager Load**: As per Question 3, within the IT department, Ed Gompf manages a notably higher number of reportees (76) compared to peers like Mariano Mauray (25). This disparity underscores the need for reassessment of managerial assignments to ensure balanced workloads and effective management."

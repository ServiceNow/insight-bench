    "summary": "\n\n1. **Processing Time Variability**: From Question 1, it was found that processing times for high-value requests vary significantly across departments, with Customer Support showing the widest range. This suggests potential inefficiencies or a lack of standardized processes within this department.\n\n2. **Expense Report Distribution**: Question 2 revealed that the Assets category dominates the number of expense report submissions, while Travel, despite having a high rejection rate, is not the most submitted category. This indicates a need for focused management and compliance monitoring in the Assets category.\n\n3. **Complexity of Travel Expense Guidelines**: Question 3 highlighted the potential complexity of travel expense guidelines compared to other categories. This suggests a need for a thorough review of the guidelines and possibly simplifying them to reduce rejection rates and improve compliance."

    "summary": "\n\n1. **Departmental Processing Efficiency**: From Question 1, it was found that the HR department has the longest average processing time for requests, suggesting potential inefficiencies or resource constraints. This insight highlights the need for process optimization within HR to improve responsiveness.\n\n2. **Tenure and Rejection Rates**: Question 2 revealed that employees with less than three years of tenure experience higher rejection rates for expense submissions. This suggests a learning curve in understanding expense policies, indicating a need for enhanced training and support for newer employees.\n\n3. **Rejection Distribution by Department**: According to Question 3, the distribution of expense report rejections among new hires is proportional to the volume of submissions by department. This implies that higher rejection numbers are a result of increased activity rather than specific departmental issues, pointing towards the importance of comprehensive onboarding across all departments."

❓ QUESTIONS
----------------------------------------
• {'question': 'What are the average resolution times for incidents across various categories and priorities?', 'task': 'Network Analysis'}

📌 METADATA
----------------------------------------
• dataset_description: The dataset includes 571 rows and 92 columns, many of which contain crucial information about incidents logged in a service management system. Columns capture diverse attributes including incident identifiers, times and dates of activity, incident state, impact, priority, and various textual descriptions and notes.

📊 PREDICTIONS
----------------------------------------
• **🟢 Category: Resolution Time Efficiency**  
🔹 **🚨 Inquiry / Help Incidents Suffer from Prolonged Resolution Times**  
**"3 - Moderate" priority incidents** in the **Inquiry / Help category** exhibit an **exceptionally high average resolution time of 8126.32 hours**. This suggests significant inefficiencies, potentially due to inadequate resource allocation or process bottlenecks. **💡 Actionable Step:** Conduct a detailed process audit to identify and eliminate inefficiencies, and consider reallocating resources or implementing automated solutions to expedite resolution times.

**🟢 Category: Priority Impact Analysis**  
🔹 **🔧 Critical Software Incidents Demand Urgent Process Optimization**  
**"1 - Critical" priority incidents** in the **Software category** have a **high average resolution time of 2299.29 hours**, indicating that current processes may not be equipped to handle the complexity of these issues efficiently. **💡 Actionable Step:** Prioritize the development of specialized task forces or cross-functional teams to address critical software incidents, and invest in advanced diagnostic tools to streamline resolution processes.

**🟢 Category: Category-Specific Performance**  
🔹 **📊 Software and Inquiry / Help Categories Require Targeted Interventions**  
Both the **Software** and **Inquiry / Help categories** are experiencing **prolonged resolution times**, with critical and moderate priority incidents taking significantly longer to resolve than expected. This highlights a need for targeted interventions to improve service management outcomes. **💡 Actionable Step:** Implement category-specific training programs and leverage data analytics to identify recurring issues, enabling more effective and timely resolutions.


📋 GROUND TRUTH
----------------------------------------
• Average resolution times for 'Network' incidents have increased significantly due to introduced delays, whereas other categories remain roughly the same.

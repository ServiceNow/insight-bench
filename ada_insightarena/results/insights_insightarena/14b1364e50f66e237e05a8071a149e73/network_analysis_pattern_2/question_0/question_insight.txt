Question: How does the reassignment count influence the resolution time of high-priority incidents?
Insight: • **Positive Correlation:** There is a strong positive correlation between reassignment count and resolution time, indicating that incidents with multiple reassignments tend to have significantly longer resolution times. This suggests that reducing reassignments could improve efficiency.

• **Category Influence:** "Software" incidents, particularly with high reassignment counts, exhibit some of the longest resolution times among categories, highlighting a potential need for better resource allocation or specialized teams to handle these complex issues more effectively.

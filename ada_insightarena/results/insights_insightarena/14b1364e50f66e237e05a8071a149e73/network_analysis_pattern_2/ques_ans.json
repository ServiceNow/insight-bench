This suggests that reducing reassignments could improve efficiency.\n\n\u2022 **Category Influence:** \"Software\" incidents, particularly with high reassignment counts, exhibit some of the longest resolution times among categories, highlighting a potential need for better resource allocation or specialized teams to handle these complex issues more effectively.",

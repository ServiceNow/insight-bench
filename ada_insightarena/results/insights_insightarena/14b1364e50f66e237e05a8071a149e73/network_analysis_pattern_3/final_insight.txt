**🟢 Category: SLA Compliance and Impact Correlation**  
🔹 **⚠️ Critical SLA Compliance Gap in High-Impact Incidents**  
Only **4.41% of high-impact incidents** met their SLA requirements, with just **9 out of 204 incidents** achieving compliance. This stark disparity suggests **systemic inefficiencies**, potentially due to **resource constraints or inadequate prioritization strategies**. **💡 Actionable Step:** Conduct a thorough review of resource allocation and incident prioritization protocols to enhance SLA compliance for high-impact incidents.

**🟢 Category: Incident Prioritization and Resolution Efficiency**  
🔹 **🚀 Prioritization Misalignment Affects Resolution Times**  
Analysis reveals that **high-priority incidents** are not resolved significantly faster than lower-priority ones, indicating a **misalignment in prioritization and resource allocation**. This inefficiency could stem from **inadequate prioritization criteria or resource bottlenecks**. **💡 Actionable Step:** Reassess and refine prioritization criteria and ensure that resources are aligned with priority levels to improve resolution efficiency.

**🟢 Category: Temporal Patterns in Incident Management**  
🔹 **⏰ Peak Incident Occurrence Times Strain Resources**  
Incidents predominantly occur during **weekday afternoons**, leading to a **30% increase in resolution times** during these periods. This temporal pattern suggests that **resource allocation does not match demand peaks**, causing delays. **💡 Actionable Step:** Adjust staffing and resource allocation to better align with peak incident times, ensuring faster response and resolution during high-demand periods.

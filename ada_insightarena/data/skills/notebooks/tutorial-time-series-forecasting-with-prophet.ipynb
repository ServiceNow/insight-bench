In this notebook, we will make a time series forecast using Facebook’s time series model [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/).

Introduction to Prophet** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"1\"></a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\nThe official [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) homepage states that-\n\n   *Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.*\n\n   *Prophet is open source software released by Facebook’s Core Data Science team. It is available for download on CRAN and PyPI.*\n\n\n- So, [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) is the facebooks’ open source tool for making time series predictions.\n\n- [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) decomposes time series data into trend, seasonality and holiday effect.\n\n- **Trend** models non periodic changes in the time series data.\n\n- **Seasonality** is caused due to the periodic changes like daily, weekly, or yearly seasonality.\n\n- **Holiday effect** which occur on irregular schedules over a day or a period of days.\n\n- **Error terms** is what is not explained by the model.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **2. Advantages of Prophet** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"2\"></a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1) \n\n\n\n[Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) has several advantages associated with it. These are given below:-\n\n- **1. Accurate and fast** - Prophet is accurate and fast. It is used in many applications across Facebook for producing reliable forecasts for planning and goal setting. \n\n\n- **2. Fully automatic** - Prophet is fully automatic. We will get a reasonable forecast on messy data with no manual effort. \n\n\n- **3. Tunable forecasts** - Prophet produces adjustable forecasts. It includes many possibilities for users to tweak and adjust forecasts. We can use human-interpretable parameters to improve the forecast by adding our domain knowledge.\n\n\n- **4. Available in R or Python** - We can implement the Prophet procedure in R or Python. \n\n\n\n- **5. Handles seasonal variations well** - Prophet accommodates seasonality with multiple periods.\n\n\n\n- **6. Robust to outliers** - It is robust to outliers. It handles outliers by removing them.\n\n\n\n- **7. Robust to missing data** - Prophet is resilient to missing data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **3.

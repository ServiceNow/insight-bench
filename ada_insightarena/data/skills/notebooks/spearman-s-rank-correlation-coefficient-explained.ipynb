It assesses **how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a monotonic function.**\n\nThe Spearman correlation between two variables is equal to the Pearson correlation between the rank values of those two variables; while Pearson's correlation assesses linear relationships, Spearman's correlation assesses **monotonic relationships** (whether linear or not). If there are no repeated data values, a **perfect Spearman correlation of +1 or −1 occurs when each of the variables is a perfect monotone function of the other.**\n\nIntuitively, the Spearman correlation between two variables will be **high** when observations have a **similar** (or identical for a correlation of 1) rank (i.e. relative position label of the observations within the variable: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) between the two variables, and **low** when observations have a **dissimilar** (or fully opposed for a correlation of −1) rank between the two variables.\n\nSpearman's coefficient is appropriate for **both continuous and discrete ordinal variables**.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Formula\n\n$${r_{s}=1-{\\frac {6\\sum d_{i}^{2}}{n(n^{2}-1)}}}$$\n\nWhere:\n- $d_{i} = R(X_{i}) - R(Y_{i})$ is the difference between the two ranks of each observation.\n- $n$ is the number of observations.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Practical example\n\nLet's see a practical example to know how it is calculated.

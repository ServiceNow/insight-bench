### Key Steps for Implementing LSTM in Python

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - **Reading Data:** Load the dataset from a CSV file, combining 'Date' and 'Time' columns into a single datetime index.
   - **Handling Missing Values:** Replace missing values in each column with the mean of that column to ensure data completeness.

2. **Data Manipulation:**
   - **Reshaping and Scaling:** Convert data to a float type and scale it to a range of [0, 1] using MinMaxScaler.
   - **Splitting Data:** Divide the scaled data into training and test sets, with the training set covering the first year of data.
   - **Reshaping for LSTM:** Reshape the data into a 3D array format suitable for LSTM input, with dimensions [samples, time steps, features].

3. **Model Implementation:**
   - **Defining the LSTM Model:** Create a Sequential model with an LSTM layer of 100 units, followed by a Dropout layer to prevent overfitting, and a Dense layer for output.
   - **Compiling the Model:** Use 'mean_squared_error' as the loss function and 'adam' as the optimizer.
   - **Training the Model:** Fit the model on the training data for 20 epochs with a batch size of 70, using the test set for validation.

4. **Visualization:**
   - **Plotting Loss:** Generate a plot to visualize the training and validation loss over epochs, helping to assess model performance and convergence.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - **Metrics:** The model is evaluated using mean squared error during training, which is a common metric for regression tasks.

6. **Save Results:**
   - **Saving the Model:** Save the trained model to a specified path for future use or deployment.

7. **Main Execution:**
   - **Integration:** Combine all steps into a main function that orchestrates data preparation, transformation, model training, visualization, and saving of results.

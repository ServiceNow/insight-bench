### Summary of KNN Imputation Pipeline

#### Data Preparation
1. **Load Data**: 
   - Use a function to read a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.

#### Data Manipulation
2. **Select Features**:
   - Extract specific columns (features) from the DataFrame for further processing.

#### Model Implementation
3. **KNN Imputation**:
   - Implement K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation using `KNNImputer` from scikit-learn.
   - Set the number of neighbors (`n_neighbors`) to 5 by default.
   - Transform the data to fill in missing values and return the imputed data as a DataFrame.

#### Visualization
4. **Plot Imputed Values**:
   - Create a line plot to compare original and imputed values for a specific feature.
   - Use different markers and line styles to distinguish between original and imputed data.
   - Include labels, title, and legend for clarity.

#### Evaluation
5. **Evaluate Imputation**:
   - Calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the original and imputed data to assess the imputation quality.
   - Print the MSE value for interpretation.

#### Save Results
6. **Save Imputed Data**:
   - Export the imputed DataFrame to a CSV file for future use.

#### Main Execution
7. **Execution Flow**:
   - Load the dataset with missing values.
   - Select relevant features for imputation.
   - Perform KNN imputation on the selected features.
   - Visualize the imputation results for a chosen feature.
   - Evaluate the imputation performance using MSE.
   - Save the imputed data to a CSV file.

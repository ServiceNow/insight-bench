### Summary of DBSCAN Clustering Pipeline

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Load the dataset from a CSV file using a function that reads the file into a pandas DataFrame.

2. **Data Manipulation:**
   - Select specific features from the dataset for clustering.
   - Standardize the selected features using `StandardScaler` to ensure they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

3. **Model Implementation:**
   - Implement the DBSCAN clustering algorithm using the `DBSCAN` class from scikit-learn.
   - Set parameters such as `eps` (the maximum distance between two samples for them to be considered as in the same neighborhood) and `min_samples` (the number of samples in a neighborhood for a point to be considered as a core point).
   - Fit the model to the preprocessed data and predict cluster labels.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Create a scatter plot of the clustered data using matplotlib.
   - Use different colors to represent different clusters, and label the axes and the plot for clarity.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Print the unique cluster labels identified by the DBSCAN algorithm to understand the number of clusters formed.
   - Note: The evaluation can be extended with additional metrics if ground truth labels are available.

6. **Save Results:**
   - Save the cluster labels to a CSV file for further analysis or record-keeping.

7. **Main Execution:**
   - Execute the entire pipeline by loading the data, preprocessing it, performing DBSCAN clustering, visualizing the results, evaluating the clusters, and saving the results to a file.

**A/B Testing** is a method used to compare two versions of a product or feature by splitting a user base into two groups (control and treatment) to see which version yields better results. It involves making a change to one element and observing its impact on user behavior or conversion rates. This is vital for businesses to ensure decisions are based on actual data rather than assumptions.

The process involves:
1. **Defining Goals**: Identifying the objective, such as increasing the Click Through Rate (CTR).
2. **Identifying Metrics**: Selecting metrics like CTR to assess performance.
3. **Developing Hypothesis**: Establishing hypotheses to compare Design A (control) with Design B (treatment).
4. **Setting Up Experiment**: Determining sample size, test duration, and randomizing participants.
5. **Running the Experiment**: Conducting the test over a set period with a specific number of users.
6. **Analyzing Results**: Using statistical tests, like t-tests, to compare the results and determine if the changes have a significant impact on the metrics.

This testing approach helps businesses make informed, data-driven decisions and avoid costly mistakes.

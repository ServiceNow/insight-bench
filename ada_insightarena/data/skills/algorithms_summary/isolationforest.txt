### Summary of IsolationForest Implementation

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Load the dataset from a CSV file using pandas.
   - Remove columns with more than 1000 missing values.
   - Fill missing values in specific columns (`GarageYrBlt`, `GarageArea`, `GarageCars`) with 0.
   - For remaining categorical columns, fill missing values with 'None'.
   - For remaining numerical columns, fill missing values with 0.

2. **Data Manipulation:**
   - Perform feature engineering by clipping outliers in specific features:
     - Clip `LotArea` values between 1300 and 50000.
     - Clip `YearBuilt` values between 1880 and 2010.

3. **Model Implementation:**
   - Use the `IsolationForest` algorithm from scikit-learn for anomaly detection.
   - Initialize the model with a maximum of 100 samples and a specified random state.
   - Fit the model to each numerical feature (excluding object types and 'Id') individually.
   - Calculate and store outlier scores for each feature in a results DataFrame.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Not implemented in the exemplar. Users can create visualizations based on their specific needs.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - The results DataFrame contains the original feature values, their corresponding outlier scores, and the feature names, which can be used for further analysis.

6. **Save Results:**
   - Save the trained model and results to specified output paths using joblib for the model and CSV for the results.

7. **Main Execution:**
   - Integrate all steps in a main function:
     - Prepare and transform the data.
     - Implement the Isolation Forest model.
     - Save the model and results.
     - Note: Visualization function is mentioned but not implemented.

### Summary of RFM Pipeline Implementation

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Load transaction data from a CSV file, ensuring that transaction dates are parsed as date objects for further analysis.

2. **Data Manipulation:**
   - Calculate the recency, frequency, and monetary value (RFM) for each customer:
     - **Recency:** Determine the number of days since the last transaction for each customer, considering only transactions from the last two years.
     - **Frequency:** Count the number of transactions per customer.
     - **Monetary Value:** Sum the transaction amounts for each customer.
   - Aggregate these metrics into an RFM table grouped by customer ID.

3. **Model Implementation:**
   - Assign RFM scores to each customer by dividing the recency, frequency, and monetary value into quartiles:
     - Recency is scored inversely (lower recency gets a higher score).
     - Frequency and monetary value are scored directly (higher values get higher scores).

4. **Visualization:**
   - Create a bar plot to visualize the distribution of combined RFM scores, which are concatenated strings of the individual R, F, and M scores.
   - Label the plot with appropriate titles and axis labels to convey insights about customer segmentation.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Provide a statistical summary of the RFM scores using descriptive statistics to understand the distribution and central tendencies of the scores.

6. **Save Results:**
   - Export the RFM scores to a CSV file for further analysis or reporting.

7. **Main Execution:**
   - Execute the entire pipeline by loading the data, calculating RFM metrics, assigning scores, visualizing the distribution, analyzing the scores, and saving the results. This is encapsulated in a main function to streamline the process.

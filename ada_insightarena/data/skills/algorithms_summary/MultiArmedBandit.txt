### Summary of Multi-Armed Bandit Pipeline Implementation

#### Data Preparation
1. **Initialize Parameters**: Set the number of arms and a random seed for reproducibility.
2. **Generate Reward Probabilities**: Create random reward probabilities for each arm using a uniform distribution.
3. **Identify Best Arm**: Determine the arm with the highest reward probability.
4. **Label Arms**: Assign labels to each arm for identification.

#### Data Manipulation
- **Placeholder for Future Manipulations**: Currently, the reward probabilities are used directly without any transformation or manipulation.

#### Model Implementation (Multi-Armed Bandit)
1. **Class Definition**: Define a `MultiArmedBandit` class to encapsulate the bandit logic.
2. **Initialization**: Store the number of arms and their respective reward probabilities.
3. **Run Iterations**: Execute multiple iterations to simulate the bandit process:
   - Collect reward histories and exploration counts over specified iterations and time steps.
   - Calculate average and standard deviation of rewards and exploration counts.
4. **Run Episode**: For each time step, select an arm, receive a reward, and update expected reward probabilities and exploration counts.
5. **Step Function**: Randomly select an arm and determine the reward based on its probability.
6. **Update Function**: Adjust the expected reward probability and exploration count for the selected arm.
7. **Performance Plotting**: Visualize the average reward over time with confidence intervals.

#### Visualization
- **Reward Probability Plot**: Create a bar chart to display the reward probabilities of each arm, highlighting the best arm in a different color.

#### Evaluation
1. **Run Evaluation**: Execute the bandit over multiple iterations and time steps to gather performance metrics.
2. **Plot Performance**: Visualize the average reward history with standard deviation to assess the algorithm's performance.

#### Save Results
- **Export to CSV**: Save the average reward history and exploration counts to a CSV file for further analysis.

#### Main Execution
1. **Setup**: Define the number of arms and prepare the data.
2. **Model Initialization**: Instantiate the `MultiArmedBandit` class with the prepared data.
3. **Visualization**: Display the initial reward probabilities.
4. **Evaluation**: Run the evaluation process and visualize the results.
5. **Save Outputs**: Store the results in a CSV file for record-keeping.

This structured approach provides a comprehensive pipeline for implementing and evaluating a multi-armed bandit algorithm in Python, with clear steps for data preparation, model implementation, visualization, and result evaluation.

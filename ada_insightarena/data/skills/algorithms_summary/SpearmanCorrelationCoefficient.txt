### Summary of Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient Pipeline

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Load the dataset from a CSV file using a function that reads the file into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Data Manipulation:**
   - Prepare the data by selecting specific columns and removing any missing values to ensure clean data for analysis.

3. **Model Implementation:**
   - Implement the Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient calculation using a function that takes two columns from the data and computes the correlation and p-value using the `scipy.stats.spearmanr` method.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Visualize the relationship between the two variables using a scatter plot with Seaborn's `jointplot`, which also displays the Spearman correlation statistic.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Print the Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient and the p-value to evaluate the strength and significance of the correlation.

6. **Save Results:**
   - Save the correlation results (correlation coefficient and p-value) to a JSON file for future reference or reporting.

7. **Main Execution:**
   - Execute the entire process in a main function that:
     - Loads the data.
     - Prepares the data by selecting relevant columns.
     - Computes the Spearman correlation.
     - Visualizes the correlation.
     - Evaluates and prints the results.
     - Saves the results to a file.

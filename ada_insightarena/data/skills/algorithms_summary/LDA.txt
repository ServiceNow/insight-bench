### LDA Implementation Pipeline Summary

1. **Required Imports**
   - Import necessary libraries: `pandas` for data handling, `CountVectorizer` for text vectorization, `LatentDirichletAllocation` for topic modeling, `matplotlib.pyplot` for visualization, and `pickle` for saving the model.

2. **Data Preparation**
   - Load the dataset from a CSV file using `pandas` and extract the text column for analysis.

3. **Data Manipulation**
   - Preprocess the text data using `CountVectorizer`:
     - Set `max_df=0.95` to ignore terms that appear in more than 95% of the documents.
     - Set `min_df=2` to include terms that appear in at least 2 documents.
     - Remove English stop words.
   - Transform the text data into a document-term matrix (DTM).

4. **Model Implementation**
   - Train a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model:
     - Specify the number of topics (`n_components`) to discover, defaulting to 5.
     - Use a random state for reproducibility.
     - Fit the LDA model to the document-term matrix.

5. **Visualization**
   - Plot the top words for each topic:
     - Create subplots for each topic.
     - For each topic, identify and plot the top words and their weights.
     - Customize the plot with titles and axis labels for clarity.

6. **Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the LDA model using:
     - Log-Likelihood: A higher value indicates a better model fit.
     - Perplexity: A lower value indicates a better model fit, calculated as the exponential of the negative log-likelihood per word.

7. **Save Results**
   - Save the trained LDA model to a file using `pickle` for future use.

8. **Main Execution**
   - Execute the main function to:
     - Load and preprocess the data.
     - Train the LDA model.
     - Visualize the topics.
     - Evaluate the model's performance.
     - Save the model to a file.

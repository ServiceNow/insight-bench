Given the following DataFrame ('df') and question, generate Python code **based on the information given in the skill exemplars** using Matplotlib/Seaborn to create a plot that effectively answers the question by applying the appropriate data analytics technique. Think step by step. Reason out how the code is bug free before you write the code.

### Input Details:
1. **DataFrame Information**:
<df_info>
{df_info}
</df_info>

2. **DataFrame Description**:
<df_description>
{df_description}
</df_description>

3. **First Few Rows of the DataFrame**:
<df_head>
{df_head}
</df_head>

4. **Skill Exemplar Summary**:
The following describes the data analytics technique to be applied:
{skill_exempler_summary}

5. **Question**:
{question}

### Instructions:
Generate a complete Python script enclosed in triple backticks (```) that follows these guidelines:

1. **Data Preparation & Cleaning**:
- Use the provided DataFrame ('df') and ensure the data is in the required format. 
- Assume that the data is loaded correctly in a pandas dataframe with variable name 'df'. **DO NOT CREATE YOUR OWN DATA **.
- Apply necessary preprocessing steps (e.g., typecasting, handling missing values, removing problematic rows).
- Implement transformations, feature engineering, or encoding. Ensure the data is cleaned and transformed to the required format.

2. **Data Analytics Technique**:
- Apply the methodology described in the skill exemplar to extract insights relevant to the question.
- You should **use the data analytics technique described in the skill exemplar summary** to solve the question. Reason why this skill is useful.
- If a model is required, implement it using the specified algorithm and parameters.
- If model training is computationally expensive, limit training to **one epoch**.
- The **evaluation** should always be reported on the **entire df** than just the val split.

3. **Visualization & Answer Extraction**:
- Ensure the visualization explicitly **incorporates and represents the results of the applied data analytics technique**.
- Choose an appropriate plot type that best conveys insights from the model/analysis.
- Include clear labels, a title, and an appropriate legend.
- Ensure the visualization directly **answers the question based on the model's output**.
- Before saving the plot, **check if the plot is valid** i.e. it is not empty. If it is empty, regenerate the code.
- Save the plot as `{savedir}/plot.jpeg`.

4. **Compute & Store Key Statistics**:
- Create a dictionary named `stats` to store relevant quantitative values related to the analysis.
- Include key metrics such as:
    - Any computed statistical summaries or model performance metrics.
    - Any values that were used to generate the visualization.
    - Any values that are related to the data analytics skill used.
- Ensure `stats` is clearly structured and printed at the end of the script.

5. **Code Robustness & Readability**:
- Use **try-except blocks** to handle potential exceptions during data processing, model execution, and visualization.
- If an exceptions occurs, **raise an error** to stop the execution than continuing with the exceptions
- Store intermediate results in well-named variables to avoid redundant calculations.
- Provide concise, meaningful comments explaining how each step aligns with the skill exemplar.
- Do **not** include `plt.show()` in the output.

Your generated code should:
1. Produce a visualization that effectively presents insights derived from the applied data analytics technique and answers the given question.
2. Generate a `stats` dictionary containing all the key numerical values used in the analysis.
3. Print the `stats` dictionary at the end of execution.

You are an expert technical summarizer. Below is a skill exemplar that explains how to implement a specific data analytics technique in Python. Your task is to:
1. Summarize the key steps in the skill exemplar, focusing on:
- Data preparation (e.g., cleaning, transformations, encoding).
- Data Manipulation (if needed)
- Model implementation (e.g., algorithm, parameters).
- Visualization (e.g., types of plots, insights).
- Evaluation (e.g., metrics, outputs).
2. Avoid copying code directly; instead, describe what the code is doing in a concise and clear way.
3. Structure the summary in bullet points or numbered steps, making it easy to understand and follow.
